# Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

# Use imperative mood i.e. "spoken as a command". "Add something", 
# "Update something", "Refactor something", etc. A properly formed 
# git commit subject line should always be able to complete the 
# following sentence: "If applied, this commit will <your subject 
# line here>"
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary (wrapped at 72 chars).
# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequenses of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#    vary here
#
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
# like this:
#
# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789
